# Anywhere Rules

Rule sets for [Anywhere](https://github.com/NodePassProject/Anywhere), converted from public rule sources into importable `.arrs` and `.amrs` files.

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## About Anywhere

[Anywhere](https://github.com/NodePassProject/Anywhere) is a native proxy client built entirely with Swift. It has no Electron, no WebView, and is not a sing-box wrapper. It implements protocols directly from the lower layers, supports vless, trojan, hysteria, shadowsocks, http, and other mainstream protocols, and focuses on stability and performance.

## Contents

- `rules/common/` - curated routing rule sets for daily use.
- `rules/all/` - full converted routing rule sets from blackmatrix7. Large rule sets are split into 100,000-rule chunks for Anywhere imports.
- `mitm/` - experimental MITM rule sets and related reject rule sets.

## Usage

### Routing Rules

Open an `anywhere://add-rule-set` link to import a `.arrs` rule set into Anywhere.

```text
anywhere://add-rule-set?link=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fchikacya%2Fanywhere-rules%2Fmain%2Frules%2Fcommon%2FAI.arrs
```

Some rule sets include a `routing` header, so Anywhere can assign their initial target automatically on import. Other rule sets stay at Default until you choose `DIRECT`, `REJECT`, or a proxy policy.

### MITM Rules

MITM rules are experimental and are provided for learning and research only.

Import `.amrs` files into Anywhere MITM rule sets. Some MITM rules also need a matching reject rule set, such as `mitm/DomainReject.arrs`, imported as a routing rule set and assigned to `REJECT`.

Only enable MITM for traffic you are allowed to inspect.

## Common Rules

Suggested targets are only a starting point. Pick the policy that matches your own proxy setup.

## Update

GitHub Actions updates generated rules daily. The workflow converts blackmatrix7 rules, builds common rules, extracts `GeoIP_CN` from `Country.mmdb`, and extracts `Geosite_CN` from `geosite.dat`.

## Notes

Anywhere routing rule sets currently support domain suffix, domain keyword, IPv4 CIDR, and IPv6 CIDR. Unsupported upstream rule types are skipped during conversion.

Each custom Anywhere rule set can contain at most 100,000 rules. This repository automatically splits larger generated rule sets into numbered parts.
